# EUPL License Information

This organization licenses most of its public content under the EUPL-1.2-or-later license.
This license is not widely known, and its official documentation (like for any license) can be overwhelming for some users. 
As such, we provide a brief overview of the license below.

## Disclaimer

Please note that we provide this document to give a general understanding of the EUPL, as well as explain how we interpreted it.

**This document is not intended to provide legal advice!**

If you are considering contributing or modifying the code or creating a derivative work,
we recommend that you read the full license and official documentation to understand your rights and obligations fully.

We welcome any correction should we've got something wrong!

## What is EUPL?

The European Union Public License (EUPL) is a free software license developed by the European Commission.
It is designed to be compatible with other open-source licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Like the GPL, 
the EUPL-1.2 is a copyleft license that requires users to make any changes to the software available to others. 

However, it is more permissive than the GPL in that it allows users to distribute the software for any purpose, 
including commercial purposes, as long as they follow the license terms. 

It is also similar to other permissive licenses, such as the MIT License, 
in that it allows users to freely use and modify the software. However, it has additional requirements, 
such as including a copy of the license and credit the original authors.

## Translations

The EUPL is available in 23 languages on the following website: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl. 
All translations have the same legal meaning in their respective countries within the European Union.

## What Does This Mean for You?

Here are some key points to consider when using or modifying content licensed under the EUPL:

**Attribution**: 
Keep all copyright notices intact and clearly state any modifications made to the content, including the date of modification.

**Copyleft**: 
Any copies or derivatives of the content must be made under the terms of the EUPL-1.2. 
Do not offer or impose any additional terms or conditions that alter the terms of the license.

**Compatibility**: 
Derivative works that include code licensed under a compatible license may be licensed under that compatible license. 
Please refer to the official license and documentation for more information on sublicensing.

**Source code**: 
You must provide the source code when using copies of the content.

**Legal protection**: 
Do not use trade names, trademarks, service marks, or the names of the licensor for anything 
other than reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the content and reproducing the copyright notice.

## Official Guidelines

You can find a detailed explanation of your rights and obligations under the EUPL in 22 languages at the following website:

## Compatibility

You can find a compatibility matrix for OSI-approved F/OSS licenses at 
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/matrix-eupl-compatible-open-source-licences.

Please note that this is quite hefty legal stuff that I won't even attempt to summarize for people that are
potentially not really that familiar with software-licenses in the first place.

Check the guidelines and license to see what the following subsections mean.

### Compatible Upstream Licenses

The following licenses are compatible with the EUPL and may be incorporated and re-licensed within this repository:

* EUPL License
* MIT License
* Apache License 2.0
* BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License
* BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" License
* ISC License
* Creative Commons Zero v1

### Compatible Downstream Licenses

According to then compatibility clause in Article 5 of the EUPL 1.2 and in reference to the first Appendix, you are allowed to re-license derivatives based on this repository under certain conditions - like the merging with code licensed under a compatible non EUPL-License - under one of the following licenses:

* EUPL License
* GNU General Public License (GPL) v. 2, v. 3
* GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v. 3
* Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0
* Eclipse Public License (EPL) v. 1.0
* CeCILL License v. 2.1

Please note that this is glossing over crucial details, and more used as a reference for ourself to setup our internal tooling.
If you want to re-license a derivate under something else than the EUPL, you should REALLY read the EUPL!
