# Security

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

As an organization focussed on developing bots that are accessible via the internet,  
we know that any system and infrastructure can be(come) vulnerable. 

We encourage everyone to report security vulnerabilities.  
This protects us, our users, partners and stakeholders and makes the world a little more secure.

Please disclosure vulnerabilities responsibly:

### Our expectations

- We expect you to attack only dedicated test-instances. Please do never research vulnerabilities on a production server!
- We expect you to use discovered vulnerabilities for no other purpose than reporting them to us. 
- We expect you to report Vulnerabilities exclusively and privately, promptly after detection. 
- We expect you to not take actions with the intention to harm us, our users, partners, or any other stakeholder.
- We expect all interactions and contributions to follow our [Code of Conduct]

### Our promise

- We will review and respond to your report promptly and conduct an open dialog with you.
- We will provide a timeline for when we expect the vulnerability to be fixed.
- We will give you credits for your findings.
